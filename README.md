### What I learned

- 

### If I had more time I would change this

- As I said in previous READMEs: Testing, testing and more testing.
- Other than that, I am more than happy with the website and it does its job very well.

### Continued development

After this website I am going to start building my Portfolio and leave theory a little bit to the side. After my Portfolio is finished I am planning to study Testing and TypeScript.
