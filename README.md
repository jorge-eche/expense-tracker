## Overview

### The project

Users should be able to:

- Define a budget.
- Add, edit and delete their expenses.
- Experience Form Validation (basic and data form validation) for both the budget and expenses input.
- Filter through their expenses according to categories.
- See a circular progress bar of their spent money.
- Have their budget and expenses saved on Local Storage for later review.
- Reset the app, thus deleting the budget and expenses.
- Check their total and available budget and the amount spent.
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for interactive elements.

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite]([https://create-react-app.dev/](https://vitejs.dev/)) - React environment
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [CryptoCompare](https://www.cryptocompare.com/) - For the Toplist by Market Cap Full Data API
- [Tobias Ahlin Spinkit](https://tobiasahlin.com/spinkit/) - For the Spinner
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I could have added more than 10 cryptos or more than 5 currencies for comparison, but I think it really does not add much on functionality terms to the application, so I decided to stick to small numbers for simplicity.
- REST APIs are so useful, there is no limit for what they can do for you and how easy it is to implement them in your projects. From face recognition APIs to cryptos quoting, your creativity and imagination are the limit here.
- This is the first project I used Styled Components. I found it very useful as it removes vanilla CSS' specificity problems. I also liked the idea of not having CSS files all over my IDE so I will continue using it for future works. On the cons side, it can get a bit messy to read JSX files with so many custom styled components and this gets worse as the React components gets more complex.
- How to use Spinners while the page is fetching the API data.

### If I had more time I would change this

- As I said in previous READMEs: Testing, testing and more testing.
- Other than that, I am more than happy with the website and it does its job very well.

### Continued development

After this website I am going to start building my Portfolio and leave theory a little bit to the side. After my Portfolio is finished I am planning to study Testing and TypeScript.
